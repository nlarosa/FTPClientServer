		As we can see from these performance metrics, my server transferred 
		the small and big files faster than did the reference server. One
		reason for this may be that the reference server is getting requests from
		multiple clients, while my server is not known to other users. Additionally,
		the reference server may use a smaller buffer size during the file transfer,
		which would require this server to call more data write() function instances.
